# Remastered
A Work in progress remastered, dynamically-typed version of c++ using python.

## Todo
- [ ] Finish Classes (const / Constructor)
- [ ] Add Basic Commands other than print
- [ ] Switch to cpython to speed up runtime.
- [ ] Make a compiler

## What I learned
- Reading files in Python.
- Some basic python commands, ex. list, **array**.append(_item_)
- Working with JSON data.
- Classes
- Lambdas
- Recursive functions
- Global Variables
- Lexing & parsing custom data types

## Side notes
- This is one of my first 5 projects in Python, and i've been doing Python for about 5 years.
- I used the name void for functions even though it's a dynamically typed language. Needs to be changed.
- I didn't know what I was doing, I just started coding and after a while decided it would be a programming language.
- Originally, it was meant to be a CSS preproccesser like sass.
